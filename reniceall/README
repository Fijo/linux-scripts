ABOUT RENICEALL

reniceall is a simple shell script that calls pidof to get
a list of all processes sharing a given program name, then
calls renice on each of them to change their nice value.

This is basically the same as what killall does in comparison
to kill.

So what you can do would look like this:

  [esser@dual esser]$ reniceall 5 bash
  8490: old priority 0, new priority: 5
  2059: old priority 0, new priority: 5
  2041: old priority 0, new priority: 5
  2023: old priority 0, new priority: 5

If you happen to forget the order of the arguments, call it
with -h or --help:

  [esser@dual esser]$ reniceall -h
  reniceall renices several processes with same name.
  Syntax: reniceall nicevalue name

When called as root, you can set negative values, just the
same way you could do that manually with renice.


INSTALLING

To install the tool, simply untar the archive and call the
install.sh script. Note: The install script will not check
if you have pidof, but the reniceall script will not work if
it isn't available.
